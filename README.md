# car_program
This program will allow users (car dealerships) to create a database for their comapany to store information about cars. It currently provides some basic functionality such as:
  a.) Creating car objects
      - Information about make, model, year, mileage.
  b.) Updating/incrementing the odometer.
  c.) Displaying formatted information about a car.

  Currently I am working on creating additonal functionality.
  
  At some point in this project I would like to create a UI.
